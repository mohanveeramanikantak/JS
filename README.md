## 📌 How React Works

React is a **JavaScript library** used to build user interfaces, mainly for **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render UI components.

### 🔹 React Key Features:
- **Component-Based**: React applications are built using reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM**: React optimizes rendering performance using a virtual DOM.
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Ensures predictable behavior and easier debugging.
- **Hooks**: Enable functional components to use state and lifecycle features.
- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing efficiently.
